# aws-cloud-resume-api
This Project focuses on building and deploying a serverless API using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, integrated with GitHub Actions.

In this project we will create a Lambda function that fetches resume data stored in DynamoDB and return it in JSON format. To level up the challenge, we will integrate GitHub Actions to automatically deploy updates to the  Lambda function whenever we push to our repository.

Test the API endpoint by applying the following command 
`curl -v https://a334k0vzma.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/resume`
